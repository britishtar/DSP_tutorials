    "# Capturing and Exploring Data from the RTL SDR\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTES:\n",
    "+ You need an RTL SDR dongle to capture data. They can be purchased for about \\$20 on Amazon.\n",
    "+ Data capture requires the **pyrtlsdr** library. Install with pip.\n",
    "+ Saving the data in SigMF format requires the **sigmf** library, which can be found on github [here](https://github.com/gnuradio/SigMF)\n",
    "+ `read_samples()` cannot capture an arbitrary number of samples. 4 seconds is about the maximum I am able to read without erroring out\n",
    "+ If you get an error when trying to read samples, chances are you will need to restart the IPython kernel\n",
